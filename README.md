# Smoking-Data-Analysis
Final Project for STA 613/ CBB 540


## Objective
A childâ€™s methylation level may depend on gender and race and may be associated with maternal smoking or unmeasured exposures associated
with maternal age, maternal BMI, maternal education level, and/or gestational age. The primary objective is to characterize the
relationships between percent methylation in the offspring and maternal smoking status adjusting for any other key covariates. A secondary
objective is to determine if the relationship between smoking and methylation is the same across race and gender.
